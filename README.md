Card Score Power-Up for Trello



This Trello Power-Up provides a simple, visual way to assign and track scores (e.g., Priority, Effort, Risk) directly on Trello cards using custom badges and a dedicated section on the card back.

‚ú® Features
Card Badges: Displays the assigned score (Low, Medium, or High) directly on the card face for quick identification.

Color-Coded Status: Scores are automatically color-coded for visual prioritization:

üü¢ Low (Green)

üü° Medium (Yellow)

üî¥ High (Red/Orange)

Card Button: A dedicated "Set Score" button on the card back opens a simple selection pop-up.

Card Back Section: A persistent section on the card details view displays the current score.

Data Persistence: Scores are stored using the Power-Up's shared data storage, meaning the score is available to all users on the board.
